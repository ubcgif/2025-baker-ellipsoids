    """
    Class creates case of a trixial ellipsoid, storing geometric properties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b, c : float
        Semiaxis lengths of the ellipsoid. Must satisfy the condition a > b > c
        for the triaxial ellipsoid case.
    
    yaw : float
        Rotation about the vertical (z) axis, in degrees.
    pitch : float
        Rotation about the northing (y) axis, in degrees.
    roll : float
        Rotation about the easting (x) axis, in degrees.
    
    origin : array
        (ox, oy, oz) - origin position as an offset from some global 
        coordinate system.
        
    Properties

    ----------
    a, b: floats
        Semiaxis lengths of the ellipsoid. Must satisfy the condition a > b = c
